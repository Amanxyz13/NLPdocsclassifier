Karen reports having migraines for many years. These started as an adult,
probably 20+ years ago. They have become more severe after some hormone
therapy with Premarin was started. She notes that she was experiencing them
3 days/week and going to the ER for injections. She was started on Topiramate
about 11 years ago. It did help, and in the last two years she has not needed
ER/Urgi care visits for migraines. It was restarted a few years ago, and in
November was increased in dosage. Since that time the headaches are less
frequent but severity is about the same. She is not aware of any side effects
from the Topiramate. The headache can build into a mild headache and then
start to build up above the eye and then generalizes to the whole head. She
has light and sound sensitivity. She takes excedrin migraine first. Then she
takes Rizatriptan if the Excedrin doesn't work after 2 hours. She doesn't like to
take the Rizatriptan since it makes her sleepy. These can last 1-2 days. She is
taking Excedrin 3-4 days a week. She also has daily headaches. which are in
the whole head and are dull pressure in the front of her face (nose up). Most of
the time she doesn't wake up with a headache. She had a recent MRI brain
which was normal. Current work is entaiis a lot of computer work, 8-5 for the
State of NE DHHS.
