The UHC representative faxed this to\\r\\nme yesterday afternoon,\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the letter, the patient NAME is the problem. As stated in our appeal letter, the patient\\r\\nregistered with our clinic using his middle name of Alan. VHC showed patient name as Fames Sain. Your\\r\\nmember has informed UHC of his name and the use of his middle name of “Atfan”.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe changed the name ancl refiled claims as James Alan Sain. However, according to this October letter, the\\r\\nmedical records have his \"invalid\" middle name of Alan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only legal thing that could be done by the provider was to have an addendum put on Dr. Kline’ s\\r\\ndictation. See copy. Also attached 1s the test card dosing which has name correction. Legally, this is all that\\r\\ncan be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf UHC continues to deny this claim, your member will be billed and we will file a complaint with the\\r\\nTexas Department of Insruance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\nKaren Minyoara\\r\\nUNTHSC\\r\\n\\r\\nHealth Business Specialist\\r\\n(817) 201-3998\\r\\n\\r\\ncc: file, patient, ‘TDI pending\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE UNIVERSITY of NORTH TEXAS\\r\\nME ALTA SCIENCE CENTER a FORT WORTH\\r\\nTER BES PREP ONG | Boa Carin Bawig Mya.
